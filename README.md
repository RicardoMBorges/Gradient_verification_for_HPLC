# Gradient_verification_for_HPLC
We will explore the process of calculating and visualizing the usage of solvents in a preparative High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) system. Our focus will be on the dynamic changes in solvent B's percentage over the course of the HPLC run, understanding the gradient profile, and calculating the total volumes of solvents A and B used.
